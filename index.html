It is my goal to show the developer I am today. With all the technology there is to offer, this site will continue to change as I learn more.</p>

                    <p>With a strong passion for technology, I'm leaping into the IT world and follow my dream. To start my journey as a developer, I have attended and received certification of Full Stack Developer at GA Tech. Actively seeking an opportunity where I can learn and grow as Front End Developer. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js. The Full Stack Developer course had also exposed me to MySql and MongoDB as well.</p>
                    
                    <p class="right"> I’m creative and enjoy exploring new ideas to problem solving. My goal is to join a talented team to further learn and polish my skills as a Front-End Developer, same as where my concentration was in a group project with three other members. I’m excited to continue my learning and develop my skills to build a better site and user experience.</p>
