                    <h2>About me</h2>

                    <p>I’m a strong will and focused individual experienced working in a fast-paced detailed and focused environment. Recently attended a coding program at Georgia Tech. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js. The Full Stack Developer course had also exposed me to MySql and MongoDB as well.</p>
                    
                    <p class="right"> I’m creative and enjoy exploring new ideas to problem solving. My goal is to join a talented team to further learn and polish my skills as a Front-End Developer, same as where my concentration was in a group project with three other members. I’m excited to continue my learning and develop my skills to build a better site and user experience.</p>
