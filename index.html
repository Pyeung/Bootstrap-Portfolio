                    <p>I’m a strong will and focused individual experienced working in a fast-paced detailed and focused environment. Recently attended a coding program at Georgia Tech. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js. The Full Stack Developer course had also exposed me to MySql and MongoDB as well. I’m creative and enjoy exploring new ideas to problem solving. My goal is to join a talented team to further learn and polish my skills as a Front-End Developer, same as where my concentration was in a group project with three other members. I’m excited to continue my learning and develop my skills to build a better site and user experience.</p>
